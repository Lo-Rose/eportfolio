## Overview

This repository contains my files and documents for development of my ePortfolio as the CS-499 Computer Science Capstone course final project. The creation of this professional portfolio showcases my skills, abilities, and strengths learned and grown throughout my Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. The included artifacts from select courses in the Computer Science Program visually display and document my growth in the key categories of software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.
