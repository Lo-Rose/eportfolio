### Showcasing my Strengths

The creation and maintenance of an ePortfolio has many benefits, including visually demonstrating your value and skills to potential employers. It has allowed me to organize and reflect on what I have learned throughout my program at Southern New Hampshire University. It allows me to visually display my strengths and set clear goals of what I want to achieve, helping me to become more desirable to potential employers. My ePortfolio displays not only key pieces of my work throughout the program but also my many achievements of honor roll and President’s list for 4 years. The content, including my chosen artifacts, showcased in my ePortfolio displays my growth in the key categories of Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.

My ePortfolio demonstrates the knowledge and skills I have successfully gained and strengthened during my studies in the Computer Science program. I display high quality professionally created visual and written communications that display my capabilities and are designed with a specific context and audience in mind. 

I have studied Computer Science at SNHU for 4 years. I joined the program to improve my skills and achieve my goals. I am originally a self-taught programmer, who began learning a few languages at the age of 12. I really enjoy engineering and figuring out how things tick. I designed several websites through geo-cities domains and developed programs in C++ and Visual Basic and Java to start. I have always had a passion for technology and work hard to strive in everything I set my mind to. Achieving Summa Cum Laude and being on the President’s List each year at SNHU shows my hard work has paid off at Southern New Hampshire University. 

During the completion of my program, I have learned an immeasurable number of skills and knowledge. I have approved my way of thinking logically and my attention to detail. Being well versed in best practices and having a security mindset, I develop my code in an organized and thought out manner. I develop my code in simple blocks, testing as I go ensuring my program works as intended and has no vulnerabilities. This helps to maintain control in the development process as the program becomes large and more complex. I continue to think with a analytic and defensive mindset to ensure I produce the best code I can.

Applying best practices and standards to  all of my work helps me to develop well formatted and reusable code that is easy to understand. I ensure that my code is well documented, leaving nothing up to interpretation. Implementing code reviews and applying security standards as well shows my attention to detail. Implementing code reviews allows me to analyze my code or my peer’s code and identify vulnerabilities or errors that may have been missed during the development process.

I have learned and utilized the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) in many projects, including large-scale projects as part of a team and as an individual. There are many factors that go into planning a large project and coordinating with team members. Understanding the client’s needs as part of the SDLC means taking those requirements and implementing them into a flowchart, pseudocode, or Alpha prototype (Game Development) that results in a Final Prototype or Program. For example, in GAM-305 I worked as the Team Lead and Art on a 5 person team and we used the SDLC for Alpha prototype, Beta prototype, and the Final Code release. We utilized both black box and white box testing through each phase. We collaborated through discord, using version control with Git and Bitbucket.

I developed a Testing and Implementation Plan with a Bug Log in an Excel spreadsheet for us to stay organized: <a href="https://snhu-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/lauren_lindhurst_snhu_edu/Documents/Gam305-TestPlanDocument.xlsx?d=w19665317088542769be89672e00aea2e&csf=1&web=1&e=10Eyvn" target="_blank">Gam305-TestPlanDocument.xlsx</a>. We also utilized the Bitbucket’s wiki feature throughout the process: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/LaurenRose/gam-305_project/wiki/Home" target="_blank">GAM-305 Project's Wiki</a>. This team project was an amazing experience to work remotely, collaborating with like minded individuals to meet the requirements of the Game Design Document and produce a successful game, superseding the expectations of the client (stakeholders). This not only increased my communication skills, but also improved my creativity and time management abilities.

As a software engineer, I know that code reviews are critical aspects of software development. They are a systematic examination (peer review) of computer source code intended to find and fix mistakes overlooked in the initial development phase, improving both the overall quality of software and the developers’ skills. 

 In the professional world of programming, code reviews are a staple of quality assurance. Code reviews help developers to learn new techniques and learn the code base, improving their skill sets. It helps to expose vulnerabilities and find ways to increase security and fix those vulnerabilities. It is vital to computer science professionals as it implements a different perspective and adds objectivity. Additionally, code reviews embrace team cohesiveness, bringing people together and nurturing collaboration.

    <p><em>Figure 1 - OpenGL 3D Visualization C++ Code Snippet</em></p>
</div>

Code reviews occur after a software developer has completed coding a project. It is the next step before merging it into the main branch or implementation. Creating a checklist for your code review it recommended. A checklist gives you or your peers a structured approach to reinforcing necessary quality checks before the code is approved. It helps to stay organized and not forget things for both the developer and the reviewer. It is also important to provide justifiable feedback regarding your stance. Providing well supported explanations, rather then just what needs to be fixed. This will not only help the developer understand your logic, but also teach them an approach on how to resolve an issue in a way they may have never considered before. 

Exercising a code review on my selected artifacts for Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases has helped me to organize and employ strategies to implement improved, portable, well designed code based upon the original functionality with added enhancements.
