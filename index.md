As a software engineer, I know that code reviews are critical aspects of software development. They are a systematic examination (peer review) of computer source code intended to find and fix mistakes overlooked in the initial development phase, improving both the overall quality of software and the developers’ skills. 

 In the professional world of programming, code reviews are a staple of quality assurance. Code reviews help developers to learn new techniques and learn the code base, improving their skill sets. It helps to expose vulnerabilities and find ways to increase security and fix those vulnerabilities. It is vital to computer science professionals as it implements a different perspective and adds objectivity. Additionally, code reviews embrace team cohesiveness, bringing people together and nurturing collaboration.

Code reviews occur after a software developer has completed coding a project. It is the next step before merging it into the main branch or implementation. Creating a checklist for your code review it recommended. A checklist gives you or your peers a structured approach to reinforcing necessary quality checks before the code is approved. It helps to stay organized and not forget things for both the developer and the reviewer. It is also important to provide justifiable feedback regarding your stance. Providing well supported explanations, rather then just what needs to be fixed. This will not only help the developer understand your logic, but also teach them an approach on how to resolve an issue in a way they may have never considered before. 

Exercising a code review on my selected artifacts for Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases has helped me to organize and employ strategies to implement improved, portable, well designed code based upon the original functionality with added enhancements.

The artifact selected for the Software Design and Engineering category is my OpenGL 3D Graphics Project. The project’s purpose is to demonstrate the skills gained creating 3D graphics in the OpenGL pipeline. The project was to select real-world objects and create three-dimensional representations of each one. Each object was to be fully textured and included the ability to orbit using a virtual camera and mouse controls. The project was originally created in October of 2022 in the CS-330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course.

I selected this artifact because it covers all aspects of the Software Design and Engineering process. It consists of the design and implementation of three-dimensional objects using application programming interface (API) libraries and computer graphic development best practices. It covers the creation of interactive graphics applications, that respond to input devices, allowing for navigation of said three-dimensional objects and through three-dimensional space. It also employs best practices in formatting, commenting, and functional logic to produce reliable computer programs, and defends program development decisions for their effectiveness in meeting project requirements. Additionally, I selected this artifact because it was one of my biggest and most challenging accomplishments through my coursework.

    <p><em>Figure 2 - OpenGL 3D Graphics Project</em></p>
</div>

The artifact is improved through the implementation of an additional object and the improvement of the original code to demonstrate the ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of applying computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry specific goals. The artifact and its enhancements introduced display computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution.

The course objectives planned in Module One were met with the implemented enhancements of the artifact. I currently do not have updates to my outcome-coverage plans, as the artifact still displays the originally discussed Computer Science program outcomes.
To reflect on the enhancement process of the artifact, I reinforced my knowledge of C++ and OpenGL libraries, strengthened my understanding that through the software design and engineering process employing formatting best practices and logic best practices ensures the program designed is functional, runs as expected, and has easy to read code that follows industry-standard practices. The challenges I overcame were simple syntax errors from cleaning up my code. They were easily resolved, and my program runs successfully with the discussed enhancements.

The artifact selected for the Algorithms and Data Structures category is my Zoo Monitoring System. The project’s purpose is to develop an authentication and authorization system that manages user and administrative access and data for a zoo. The project was created originally in October of 2018 as part of the IT-145 Foundations in Application Development computer science course. This program is developed in Java programming running in Apache Netbeans v16 IDE. It was originally written in the 8.2 version. The enhancement for this project was the modules for the monitoring system- Option 2 of the IT-145 Final Project Guidelines and Rubric.

    <p><em>Figure 3 - Rubric for Option 1 Addition IT-145</em></p>
</div>

The artifact was selected because it displays a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures to combine complex systems, one for authentication, one for authorization, and dashboards to display information regarding animals, habitats, or user management based on the logged in user’s role. After the user logs in successfully, they are only able to see menus and data specific to their role.

</div>

Specific components, such as the use of different function specific classes and methods, reading external files into a data structure of a string array variable to analyze user input conditions, reading data files line by line to evaluate conditions, and reading data files to the user’s display all showcase my skills and abilities in algorithms and data structures. 
The artifact was improved by implementing the Monitoring System (Option 2- Monitoring System from the IT-145 Rubric). The enhancement allows the user, depending on role, to display either animal information from the animals.txt file, habitat information from the habitats.txt file, or display user information from the usermanage.txt file. The artifact was also improved through the clean-up of my code and splitting of original AuthenticationSystem class to other classes to strategically organize functions and display coding best practices.

The artifact and its enhancements implement appropriate variables, operators, methods, and classes as they are used in object-oriented programming for developing successful programs. It also utilizes appropriate syntax and conventions in terms of their best practice and use in programming. Lastly, it displays a computing solution that solves a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.

</div>

The course objectives planned in Module One were met with the implemented enhancements of the artifact. I currently do not have updates to my outcome-coverage plans, as the artifact still displays originally discussed Computer Science program outcomes.

To reflect on the enhancement process of the artifact, I reinforced my knowledge of Java (OOP) and its’ libraries, I strengthened my understanding of data structures and algorithms while employing formatting best practices and logic best practices, ensuring my program design is functional, runs as expected, and has easy to read portable code that follows industry standards. The challenges I overcame were simple syntax errors as I have not written in Java in a long time and tend to automatically code everything in C++. The errors were easily resolved and with detailed comments implemented, I was able to easily resolve any issue that occurred.

<img id="databases" src="include/images/databases.png" alt="Databases" title="Databases" />

As described in the [artifact code review](CodeReview "Refinement Plan and Code Review"), the artifact selected for the databases category is the **Salvare Search for Rescue Web App**. The web application aims to develop a web interface that works with an existing database from animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs to train for different rescues. The web app was planned, designed, and developed for the CS340 Client/Server Development computer science course. The application is developed in Python with the Dash framework and the non-relational database MongoDB. The integration of Python and MongoDB is through the python driver PyMongo. The application can run in Jupyter Notebook as a test tool and the computer terminal with an internet browser. The application's functionality involves a CSV data file of existing dogs in shelters to import into MongoDB, the import of dependencies such as Python PyMongo driver, Python libraries, Dash framework, and a Python source code and CRUD module to manipulate the data imported into MongoDB.

This artifact involved a multi-tier application with a Model View Controller (MVC) and RESTful protocol design to extend the HTTP protocol to provide an application programming interface (API). The most attractive concept of the MVC pattern is a separation of concerns. The model's job is to manage the data, MongoDB, and Python data structures. The view's job is to decide what the user sees and how on their screen, Dash framework. The controller's responsibility is to pull, modify, and provide data to the user, the PyMongo driver. Each record in the MongoDB database is a document described in BSON, a binary representation of the data retrieved by the web app in a JSON format. When the main app file is executed in the computer terminal, the user opens an internet browser new tab pointing to the corresponding app address. The browser starts loading and generates the client-facing web application dashboard like the following screen:
